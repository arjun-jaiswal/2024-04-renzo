❗Important note: **this audit will use the new rules** as [announced last week](https://code4rena.com/blog/code4rena-spring-update-2024). The Renzo team is keen to start today, so we're adjusting the "effective date" for the new rules to today. 🙂 

Excited to see the new rules in action! 🚀

@kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇 in the deployment script there is cbETH, but in the readme it says they work with wBETH


[04/30/2024 21:25] kartoonjoy
Hi there. Are you suggesting it should read one or the other?


[04/30/2024 21:26] idarrha_adam
i think it should be cbETH, because in script i see only cbETH, stETH, ezETH no wBETH

If you can get confirmation, we can probably update it today.

[04/30/2024 21:52] youfoundron
@0xJJ can confirm, but I think these are just meant to demonstrate how LST's would be used in the protocol. Whether it is wbETH or cbETH should not matter.


[04/30/2024 21:57] jatinj615
Hey, confirming as Ron said it is just to demonstrate how LST’s would be used in the protocol.


[04/30/2024 21:57] idarrha_adam
it's just so we can know which tokens are meant to interact with the system


[04/30/2024 21:59] jatinj615
Currently stETH and wBETH are accepted on the protocol but it can accept other LSTs as well if configured.

[04/30/2024 22:01] idarrha_adam
ok, should we find issues about integrating with any LST or just the ones in the readme (steth, wbETH, ezETH)

You Could Have Invented EigenLayer: Explaining EigenLayer
In this blog post, we will take you through the evolution of the protocol, by covering how EigenLayer's architecture emerged from the initial concept.

[05/01/2024 15:11] youfoundron (pinned)
I will also try my best to summarize:

EigenLayer:
* To participate in EigenLayer you must stake a validator node and point its withdrawal credentials to an EigenPod
* EigenPods are used to track ETH validator balances
* An EigenPod's validator balance (tracked by submitting proofs of beacon chain activities to the EigenPod contract) translates to shares that can be delegated to operators to secure AVS's on EigenLayer
* An EigenPod can only delegate shares to a single operator

Renzo:
* We use a contract called the "OperatorDelegator" in order to manage share delegation and admin on our EigenPods.
* Every OperatorDelegator contract is responsible for only one EigenPod


[05/01/2024 15:13] youfoundron
FWIW: You should not have to understand EigenLayer in order to perform this audit. We are mainly concerned with the math and security around withdrawals and TVL calculations.

@0xJJ will describe the general withdrawal flow below:


[05/01/2024 15:20] jatinj615 (pinned)
The withdrawQueue contract get filled by 3 ways ->
1. New Deposits
2. Daily Rewards Coming in the Protocol.
3. Manual withdrawal from EigenLayer. Permissioned call from OperatorDelegator.
-> If options 1 and 2 are not sufficient to fulfil withdraw requests of Users then admin accounts will manually unstake from EigenLayer periodically through 2 step process (in case of ETH 3 steps) -
1.  OperatorDelegator.queueWithdrawals
2.a. OperatorDelegator.verifyAndProcessWithdrawals (for ETH full withdrawal from EigenLayer which requires proof submission generated Offchain ).
2.b. OperatorDelegator.completeWithdrawals.

User Withdrawal flow is 3 step process -
1. Approve ezETH amount user wants to withdraw to WithdrawQueue contract.
2. Call withdraw function in WithdrawQueue contract specifying the collateral asset and amount of ezETH to withdraw.
3. Claim the collateral asset after cooldown period from WithdrawQueue contract

How does a user initiate a withdrawal? The README on the competition repo says
> Call startWithdraw() on the RestakeManager with the amount of ezETH you want to burn and which collateral token you would like to get back 
but there's no function in the `RestakeManager` contract named `startWithdraw`  and there doesn't seem to be anything with logic that would perform the same function.


[05/01/2024 18:32] jatinj615
Hey ser @nican0r , added the user withdrawal flow in the pinned msg above. 🫡

[05/01/2024 20:06] nican0r
Awesome, thanks 🙏 ! 

Now I'm confused about where the assets received by the user in the withdrawal flow come from. It looks like the `WithdrawQueue::withdraw` function batches requests into the `withdrawRequests` array but these never actually get sent to EigenLayer.  

I saw your point above about `WithdrawQueue` being filled by new deposits and rewards coming into the protocol. Does this mean that newly deposited assets get sent to the  `WithdrawQueue` , and if so wouldn't that imply that they don't end up getting staked in EigenLayer? Does this also mean that `WithdrawQueue` is the receiving address for EigenLayer rewards?

Deposits only go to the withdrawqueue if it is below a certain threshold. Otherwise they go to the deposit queue where they await staking.

hi above is the `in scope` of the protocol. but in the connext folder there are 3 subfolders with files in each. are these 3 folders in `connext` named `core`, `integration`and `librabries` in scope?

[05/03/2024 09:16] m_rassska
yeah, basically, it's a popular attack vector! 

In two words: you provide eth(from the pool) to the node operator, who might front-run the deposit of 32 eth by replacing the withdrawal credentials and depositing minimum 1eth. On a beacon chain, you can't re-set wcs once they're setted. Also, check out the Frax contest report on c4. That issue appeared there as well.

@0xJJ what kinds of rewards go to the RewardHandler.sol contract?


[05/03/2024 12:24] jatinj615 (pinned)
Hey guys, would like to drop some common **FAQs** which we are seeing in private threads - 
1. Role of RewardHandler.sol - RewardHandler will be responsible to handle the Rewards coming in from EigenLayer. But as EigenLayer Payments system has not been finalised yet. It is expected to change accordingly. 
2. RenzoOracleL2 - This contract provides an additional feature (if configured, not yet live on prod) to continuously update the mintRate of ezETH on L2. Also, please note that it **WILL NOT** be using DEX price feed of ezETH by chainlink. Instead a custom-feed will be started which will read the exchangeRate(mintRate) of ezETH from L1. 
To read more on chainlink custom feed - https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds/#-custom-feeds
3. The revert condition in RenzoOracleL2 
```if (_scaledPrice < 1 ether) revert InvalidOraclePrice();```
- As, ezETH is a yieldBearing Token which means exchangeRate of ezETH >= 1 ETH. The revert condition is placed to provide a protection of protocol collateral against any wrong oracle feed and restricts user to deposit and mint more ezETH then they are supposed to. 
4. If you want to get understanding of xERC20 flow. would recommend this awesome documentation by connext. It would help in understanding the xReceive flow in xRenzoBridge - 
https://docs.connext.network/usecases/xerc20/setup-guide
5. Blast network support - xRenzoDeposit is not deployed on blast. Also Blast is not supported by connext hence the protocol is using Blast Native Bridge by using OptimismMintableXERC20 (xezETH contract on Blast) instead of XERC20.
6. Trusted Roles - All the Roles in The RoleManager are Trusted Roles.
7. Connext router fee of 5bps is deducted on collateral to compensate the fee on connext bridge - read here https://docs.connext.network/developers/guides/estimating-fees

In the EigenPodManager, `podOwnerShares` can have a negative value when a pod owner's virtual beacon chain ETH shares decrease between the time they queue and complete a withdrawal. This situation is described as a "share deficit." When shares are added to a pod owner's account, any existing deficit is paid off first, and only the remaining shares are added to their balance. This mechanism ensures that the withdrawal process is fair and prevents improper removal of excessive shares from the operator to whom the staker is delegated.

Thank you @Docs Wolf

Hi @0xJJ , In ReadME, it says that ERC20 used by the protocol are ezETH, stETH, wBETH. If so, what is METH of Oracle/Mantle? And what is practical value of _allocationBasisPoints?

what is the purpose of `sweepERC20` function in depositQueue?  In which cases depositQueue will receive LSTs as rewards?


[05/05/2024 17:46] jatinj615
If anyone intentionally or by mistake send the supported assets to deposit then sweepERC20 will be performed as depositQueue is not supposed to have ERC20 assets. So it will be accumulated as protocolReward.

Yeah I had to do this, it took a significant amount of time. 

I was going to request for an extension if possible because this really adds significant overhead to write POCs (I believe they're required for validating H/Ms at this point). For such a short contest period not including a test suite or at least a setup function for a test suite will significantly take away from warden's ability to create meaningful submissions leading to lower quality submissions or potentially valid submissions that couldn't be validated with a POC in time being invalidated. 

Ultimately it seems like a lose-lose for the protocol team and wardens

[05/07/2024 20:07] m_rassska
why should every H/M submission include coded POC? Can i have a source, where it's stated?


[05/07/2024 20:17] nican0r
Generally it creates a higher quality submission but I think I might've been confused with another audit competition platform, couldn't find anything in the c4 docs that it's a requirement. Maybe the judge for this competition could weigh in here.

[05/27/2024 05:14] guhu95
Can someone experienced in C4 please explain the mitigation review flow (I read [the docs](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/sponsors/contest-process#how-code4rena-mitigation-reviews-work) ) ?
1. Are the docs accurate?
2. I understand it's a separately run contest, why is it included in the pot in some cases, but not others?
3. When does it happen (says "after judging", but it's is a bit vague)? 
4. I understand it's invitational - what are the eligibility criteria and how and when do the wardens get invited in practice? Does it require any previous status within C4 (like backstage), or is it only based on that specific contest?

[05/27/2024 05:35] _3doc_
Hi,
1. you can treat docs like you do in normal contests. Code has priority over docs unless the misalignment could be a bug; you can ask the sponsor to clarify like in regular contests
2. My guess is that it’s included in the contest pot when the sponsor plans the mitigation review with the contest. It’s would not when the sponsor decides they want a mitigation review after the primary contest kicked off
3. The mitigation RSVP I’ve seen were happening at most a couple days after the awards are announced 
4. It’s a public RSVP so each will detail its own criteria, participants are generally selected based on their rank in the primary contest

[05/27/2024 07:08] tigerfrake
I've noticed that one of my submissions that I did an escalation for from the `validation repo` has a similar `issue ID` with another  issue that's been escalated by another warden.

I hope the judges don't skip it thinking it's already been handled as the one from the other warden has been handled already.
